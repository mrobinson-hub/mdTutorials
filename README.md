# MD Tutorials

I don't imagine too many people will be looking at this, but I'm creating a series of in-house tutorials for MD-adjacent concepts for the Monash Computational Chemistry Group at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. [Our group wiki](https://mccg.erc.monash.edu/Group%20Wiki/) will host the actual Markdown files, but this repository is a place to store any of the example files that need to be shared. If you're not from the group, please feel free to have a look over them - I hope they're helpful!
